## Linked List
A C++ implementation of a linked list data structure.
### Class Data Members
```l_head```: pointer to first node in linked list.  
```l_length```: number of nodes in linked list.
### Class Member Functions 
```clear```: resets end of linked list.  
```empty```: returns whether the linked list has no nodes.  
```fill```: replaces all nodes with given data.  
```get```: returns node containing given data.  
```head```: returns pointer to first node in linked list.  
```length```: returns number of nodes in linked list.  
```link```: updates pointer to first node in linked list.  
```pop```: returns and removes node at start of linked list.  
```print```: prints position and data of each node in linked list.  
```push```: inserts node at start of linked list.  
```remove```: removes node in linked list.  
```set```: updates a node with given data.
### Compile and Link

```shell
make
```
### Execute
