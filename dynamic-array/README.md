## Dynamic Array
A C++ implementation of a dynamic array data structure with the following functionality:  
```capacity```: returns current maximum capacity of array.  
```clear```: removes all elements from array.  
```expand```: doubles the maximum capacity of array.  
```get```: returns element at given index.  
```index```: returns index of given element.  
```length```: returns number of occupied elements in array.  
```pop```: returns and removes element at end of array.  
```print```: prints indexes and values of array.  
```push```: inserts element at end of array.  
```set```: replaces element at given index.  
```shrink```: halves the maximum capacity of array.
